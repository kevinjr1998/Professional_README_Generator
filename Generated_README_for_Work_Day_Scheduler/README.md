## Description  
This project involved using 3rd Party APIs to add styling to the webpage and also to help write more intuitive JavaScript to interact with the webpage and using these to create a simple day planner to help a person with a busy day manage their workload. Bootstrap was used to add the timeblocks from 9-5 to the webpage and also to style the width of the different sections of the timebox (textarea, button, etc). Moment.js was used to display the current day at the top of the webpage, and Jquery was used to interact with the webpage, fontawesome was used to get a save icon png used to display that you can save entries and a google font is used as our webpage font
