# Professional README Generator  

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description  
This application generates a README markdown file using prompts entered at the command line. The prompts are then fed into a template and variables added using template literals. The main package used to create this project was called "inquirer", which allows us to create responses to prompts on the command line and store the response. The markdown file generated has working table of contents, properly formatted links and badges and all of the typical section headings expected from a professional README file, such as license, contact info and test instructions.
